# Proceeding Paper

## Introduction

Conference proceedings typically contain the contributions made by researchers at the conference. They are the written
record of the work that is presented to fellow researchers. In many fields, they are published as supplements to
academic journals; in some, they are considered the main dissemination route; in others they may be considered grey
literature. They are usually distributed in printed or electronic volumes, either before the conference opens or after
it has closed.

MSDL allows you to curate proceeding papers published in Book, Journal, or Conference or Workshop Proceedings. Authors
and organizations can choose to publish their Proceedings and Papers in MSDL.

Proceeding papers are presented as PDF documents to MSDL Readers.
