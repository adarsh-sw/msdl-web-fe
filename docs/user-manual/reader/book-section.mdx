# Book Section

## Introduction

The Author may have divided the Books into Parts, Chapters, and Sections. MSDL curates and publishes such
`Book Sections`. A `Book Section` must have a reference to the `Book` in which it belongs to.

MSDL provides the authors and publishers option to curate `Book Sections` (e.g., book chapters or book sections)
published in print and digital elsewhere.

Authors and publishers can also choose MSDL as their platform of choice to publish their `Books` and `Book Sections`. In
such a case, 'Mekong School Digital Library' shall be the publisher.

:::tip Expore Book Section

To get a list of `Book Section`, select 'Book' in the Resource menu in MSDL header. Readers can further filter the list
of `Book Section` using the filter options: `Author`, `Publisher`, `Tags`, `Language`, `License`, and `Access`.
