# Image & Photograph

## Introduction

An image is a visual representation of something. It can be two-dimensional, three-dimensional, or somehow otherwise
feed into the visual system to convey information. An image can be an artifact, such as a photograph or other
two-dimensional picture, that resembles a subject.

Authors, creators, and photographers can curate `Image(s)` published in other Publications. They can also publish new
images and photographs they have created or taken in MSDL.
