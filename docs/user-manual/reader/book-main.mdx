# Book

## Introduction

"A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made
of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover"
[(Feather & Sturges, 2003)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book#cite_note-1).

MSDL provides the authors and publishers option to curate `Books` and `Book Sections` (e.g., book chapters or book
sections) published in print and digital elsewhere.

Authors and publishers can also choose MSDL as their platform of choice to publish their `Books` and `Book Sections`. In
such a case, 'Mekong School Digital Library' shall be the publisher.

To get a list of `Books`, select 'Book' in the Resource menu in MSDL header. Readers can further filter the list of
`Books` using the filter options: `Author`, `Publisher`, `Tags`, `Language`, `License`, and `Access`.
