# Presentation

## Introduction

A presentation conveys information from a speaker to an audience. Presentations are typically demonstrations,
introduction, lecture, or speech meant to inform, persuade, inspire, motivate, build goodwill, or present a new
idea/product.

MSDL allows you to curate presentations published elsewhere. It will also allow you publish presentation.

Presentations can be published in PDF (convering the presentation deck in PDF).
