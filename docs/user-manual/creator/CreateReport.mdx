# Report/ Report Section

A `report` is a document that presents information in an organized format for a specific audience and purpose. Although
summaries of reports may be delivered orally, complete reports are almost always in the form of written documents.

`Report Section` is a specific part of the `Report` and it can be a part, chapter, or a section. In MSDL, a
`Report Section` will have a reference to the `Report` where it was taken from.

`Report` in MSDL.
