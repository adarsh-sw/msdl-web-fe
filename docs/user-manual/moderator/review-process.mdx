# Reviewer Role

<div className="badge badge--primary heading-badge">Availablity: Reviewers</div>

Mekong School Library enables the 'Reviewer' role to designated Users. A reviewer shall review the resources submitted
for curation or publication in MSDL.

In each resource type, there is a minimum set of metadata recommended for submission. Reviewer shall check the
completeness and accuracy of the data.

MSDL aims to provide its Readers full text content. The submissions will need appropriate full text content that is well
presented. For example, a presentation may take a PDF document. However, the PDF presentation should have the width and
height of a presentation.

Reviewer shall also check the license of the content and appropriate access for MSDL Readers.

## Review List

On submission of a resource, Reviewer shall be able to get the latest submissions in the 'Review' board.

The filters (Resource Type, Author, Publisher, Tags) enable the Reviewer to filter submitted Resources.

## Examine Resources

Reviewer shall click on the resource to go through the details (we call it 'metadata') of the resource. Reviewer can
choose to edit the section to correct submitted details.

## Review Decision

Reviewer gets two options - Reject and Approve - to exercise on the submission. The rejected submission will not be
published and available in MSDL for search and view.

'Approve' will immediately publish the resource in MSDL and make it searchable.
